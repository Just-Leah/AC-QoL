1. [Download the JAR file linked at this sentence.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.enjin.com/483843/modules/forum/attachments/ac_qol-1.0.0_1628490514.jar)
2. Go to the [Fabric download page](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and download `Windows/EXE` if you are on windows. If you are on anything else, use `Universal/JAR` (Note that you need java installed if you use the jar installer)

3. Open the installer. Check to make sure that the installer setting are set to the screenshot below. The loader version can be a later version.

4. Drop the JAR file in your Minecraft mods folder, which can be found on windows by pressing windows+r, then typing `%APPDATA%/.minecraft`. If you are updating replace the file that is already there, otherwise you will run into a problem on startup
5. You will also need the Fabric API, which can be downloaded from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/versions) (Any version can be used, but I would advise using the latest one). Make sure the API is in your mods folder.
6. Open/Restart your Minecraft launcher, and use the brand new `fabric-loader-1.17.1` profile. It will load into the game with the mod if everything went well.
7. When in a server/world, press `G` and it will bring up the GUI. You can press a button to teleport to the corresponding warp and press the tabs at the top to scroll through them.
8. If you want to change the keybind to something other than `G`, just go to the vanilla Minecraft controls settings and scroll down to the bottom. It'll be there under `Open GUI`
